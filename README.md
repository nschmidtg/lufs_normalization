This Python program iterates through the audio files on a given directory computing the LUFS meter for each song. Then it creates a copy with the audio normalized at the desired LUFS to start the mastering process for a whole album.
Using an offline LUFS meter improved the mastering flow to check if the levels of the songs match the streaming platform standars.
